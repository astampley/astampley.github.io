    <p> Seattle's sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA)'s Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the Stanley Cup. Seattle's sports history continues today with the city's five major professional teams: the National Football League (NFL)'s Seattle Seahawks, Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Seattle Mariners, Major League Soccer (MLS)' Seattle Sounders FC, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)'s Seattle Storm and the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)'s Seattle Reign FC. </p>
    <h2><strong>Seahawks</strong></h2>
    <p>The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football franchise based in Seattle, Washington. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team. The Seahawks are owned by Paul Allen and are currently coached by Pete Carroll. Since 2002, the Seahawks have played their home games at CenturyLink Field (formerly Qwest Field), located south of downtown Seattle. The Seahawks previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994, 2000–2001). The Seahawks are the only NFL franchise based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, and thus attract support from a wide geographical area, including some parts of Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Alaska, as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia and Alberta. Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the "12th Man", "12th Fan", or "12s".</p>

Since July 1999, the Mariners' home ballpark has been Safeco Field, located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The "Mariners" name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle. They are nicknamed the M's, a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992. The current team colors of Navy blue, Northwest green, and silver were adopted prior to the 1993 season after having been royal blue and gold since the team's inception.
